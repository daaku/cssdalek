========

Exterminate unused CSS rules for major wins.

NOTE: This is probably not production ready, and you probably want to use
[purgecss](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss). I'm working on this because
I want something faster, so that I can enable it during development and not
get bitten in my ass when my production build deploys and I find a rule I
used got dropped.


## TODO

- [ ] Attribute Selectors
- [ ] Font Face
- [ ] Key Frames
- [ ] Media Queries
- [ ] Tables
- [ ] Psuedo Elements
- [ ] Hook up a generic parser for random file types
